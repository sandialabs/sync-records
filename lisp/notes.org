* Object design follow python on everything except:
- no modules, so libraries need to be classes (because need to package all logic into the class) 
- no properties, just single root state (because of way sync web works)
- syntax differences
  - parens instead of indent
  - *ear-muffs* instead of __dundur__
  - ~hidden instead of _hidden
  - (self 'method) instead of self.method
  - (cls 'method) instead of cls.method
  - (self) instead of self.root
  - (set! (self) root) instead of self.root = root
    
* Current issues with class
- Signature/docstring doesn't propagate to api level
- Private api doesn't show up
- Methods don't override

* Ledger level
- Should be able to transparently get/set within the same journal
  - options:
    - s7-esque implicit
      - get: (obj '(this is a -1 path to the end))
      - set: (set! (obj '(this is a path to the end)) blah)
    - explicit
      - get: ((obj 'get) '(path to -1 end in the same way))
      - set: ((obj 'set!) '(path to -1 end in the same way) '(content 5))
    - combined access
      - ((obj '(get and set to the same place -1) 'push!) (sync-null))
      - problem: might encourage too much get/setting
      - problem: prevents tail recursion on get only
        - could optimistically assume if no "!" in the name; fix later if there is mutation
      - advantage: less code
      - advantage: pretty intuitive
      - advantage: might save time if optimized later
- External records should be explicitly serialized/deserialized
  - deserialize: accept object, optional query, and optional "seen" set
  - serialize: accept serialization, optional query, and optional "seen" set
